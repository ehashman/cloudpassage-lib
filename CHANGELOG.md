## Breaking changes

- Removed public `cloudpassage-lib.core/wcar` macro that was used to speak with
  redis.
- Signature for `cloudpassage-lib.core/fetch-token!` no longer requires a fernet
  key.
- Updated documentation to reflect dependency changes.
- redis and fernet are no longer required. This due to the api changes made in
  PR #73 (https://github.com/RackSec/cloudpassage-lib/pull/73).
